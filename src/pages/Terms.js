      <Typography variant="h1">VARIATION IN PRODUCT</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Created from natural products, stems and flowers can differ, so no two
        products are exactly the same. Flower availability is also dependent on
        season and market availability. As a result, not all goods are exactly
        as pictured on our website, By accepting these terms and conditions you
        are acknowledging there may be some material differences between images
        and the goods produced. Therefore May’s Fresh Flowers cannot guarantee
        the exact color or variations of any of the plants or flowers used, but
        we will always strive to get exactly right for you.

      <Typography variant="subtitle1">Courier</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        If the recipient is not at the delivery address when our courier
        arrives, we will leave the flowers at the delivery address in a safe and
        undercover position. If necessary, we will contact the recipient or
        sender to let them know where we left the flowers. If the recipient
        lives in a unit or apartment and are not there to receive the flowers
        and there is not a safe place to leave the flowers, we will attempt to
        contact the recipient or re-arrange the delivery which will incur an
        extra cost to the sender. If the wrong delivery address is given, we
        will re-deliver the order, however there will be an additional delivery
        cost. All deliveries are wet-packed to ensure they stay hydrated and
        protected during the delivery process.

        span is dependent on the variety, season, environment and care, thus
